**Description:**

**Polar Explorer is now available for download on
[iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/polar-explorer-sea-level/id1056414420?ls=1&mt=8)!**

Have you ever wanted to answer questions for yourself about changes that
are occurring that relate to climate? With the Polar Explorer app you
can do just that.  The app allows users to pose questions that take them
through an individualized tour exploring the data that scientists
collect presented for the everyday user in interactive maps and
visualizations. Real data about the polar-regions and their connection
to the rest of the world are readily available and easy to navigate.

Polar Explorer’s interactive maps are loaded with data to support the
most curious of travelers. Users can travel all over the world exploring
how the polar regions are connected to some of climate’s biggest impacts
starting with global and local sea level.

Questions help the user navigate through a range of topics, including:

-   What exactly is sea level and how do we measure it?
-   Why does sea level change?
-   Where is it changing now?
-   What was sea level in the past and what might are scientists
    predicting for the future?

Maps include short introductions on how to view the map, and audios with
‘a little more about the subject’.  The data that is behind the maps and
images is collected and updated by scientists around the world.
