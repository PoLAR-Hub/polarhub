**Description:**

The American Museum of Natural History's online teacher professional
development course on Climate Change explores the science of climate
change, with a special emphasis on the important role played by the
polar regions. Middle and high school teachers learn how the climate
system works; what factors cause climate to change across different time
scales and how those factors interact; how climate has changed in the
past; how scientists use models, observations and theory to make
predictions about future climate; and the possible consequences of
climate change for our planet.  Teachers learn about valuable resources,
tools, and activities that can be implemented in their classrooms, and
also contribute to a curriculum repository.  

A related series of online courses for adults is also available.  For
more information, please visit AMNH's [Our Earth's
Future](https://www.coursera.org/learn/earth-climate-change) course page
on Coursera. 

**Annoucement:**

AMNH recently launched a [curriculum collection on polar climate
change](http://www.amnh.org/explore/curriculum-collections/polar-climate-change-lesson-plans),
developed by educator's who completed the online course!  These lesson
plans are teacher tested and ready to use in the classroom.  

The AMNH course for teachers is offered several times throughout the
year.  For more information, and to register, visit the [AMNH Climate Change course](http://www.amnh.org/learn/climate?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Sept%2013&utm_content=Sept%2013+Preview+CID_70981ac7a42c2c1780e8de1e45aeec9d&utm_source=Email%20marketing%20software&utm_term=online%20course%20about%20climate%20change)webpage.

**Stipends are available!**  We are looking for 100 science teachers to
participate in our Seminars on Science Climate Change program. Each
participant will receive a $500 stipend to offset the cost of
completing the [online course about climate
change](http://seminarsonscience.cmail2.com/t/r-i-buttutd-l-o/). The
course is available for graduate credit at several of our partner
institutions for an additional cost.

Please [complete this form](http://seminarsonscience.cmail2.com/t/r-i-buttutd-l-m/) to
apply. Selected participants will be notified on a rolling basis.
