**Description:**

Everyone is talking about climate change, but what does it all mean? Listen in as Polar Voices breaks down the science of climate change with people living and working in the polar regions. 

Polar Voices is an educational podcast that explores climate change in the Arctic and the Antarctic. The program uses current research to explain observations made by people living and working near the poles, focusing particularly on Arctic Indigenous peoples. The main goal of Polar Voices is to increase knowledge and awareness of climate change among lifelong listeners from a broad range of socioeconomic and educational backgrounds. For listeners with limited initial knowledge of climate change, the programs present scientific information in simple and concise language. For listeners with moderate or advanced knowledge of climate change, Polar Voices relay true stories from Arctic Indigenous communities experiencing and adapting to change and discuss actions people and communities are taking to mitigate climate change locally.
