**Description:**
The polar regions are special places full of unique animals who depend on sea ice to live. They are also the fastest changing places on Earth. How do these changes affect the ecosystems, what can the animals do to survive, and how can you help?

EcoChains is a fun and easy-to-learn card game for all ages. In these 2-4 player games of strategy and survival, players build food webs, learn about the importance of sea ice, and see the potential impact of future changes on the ecosystem.

PoLAR started the EcoChains series with Arctic Crisis, which is available for purchase at [ecochainsgame.com](ecochainsgame.com). In collaboration with scientists at the [Palmer Long Term Ecological Research Station](http://pal.lternet.edu/), partners developed an Antarctic version of the game to focus on the Western Peninsula marine ecosystem. These games are being used by the Norwegian cruise company Hurtigruten as part of an [on-board educational program](https://www.hurtigruten.us/us-news/hurtigrutens-young-explorers-program-offers-age-appropriate---learning-experience-to-kids-during-antarctica-sailings/). Most recently, PoLAR created a quick-play version of the game, which is for sale at the American Museum of Natural History's main gift shop. This simplified 2-player game, Arctic Life, won a [Parents' Choice Award](http://www.parents-choice.org/product.cfm?product_id=35014&StepNum=1&award=aw) in spring 2017. 

**What players are saying:**

“I was amazed by how interconnected the entire system of Arctic species are, and realized how much would be affected by just a few minor changes.”

 “I certainly felt an adrenaline rush as I kept the possibility of a major disaster impacting my web at the forefront of my mind to strategize the best possible food web combination.”
