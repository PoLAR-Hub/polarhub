**Description:**

The FutureCoast collaborative storytelling game is a public online/voicemail experience that ran from early February through the end of April 2014, and also includes in-person facilitated experiences that are run in classroom, at workshops, and in museums. FutureCoast asked the general public for their visions of what possibly climate-changed futures may be like.  The voicemails you hear at [FutureCoast.org](http://futurecoast.org/) were generated by participating members of the public.

By framing this player-created storyspace and making the future seem real today, the game created an engine for engaging people in “futurethinking”, helping them to visualize and plan for future climate changes. Climate science offered them platforms on which to build their stories. FutureCoast is part of an "arts + science" movement that creates approaches for wider public participation in climate change narratives in order to foster deeper engagement and understanding.

FutureCoast echoes common strategic planning exercises commonly used by corporations and the military, which use “what if?” scenarios to engage people in envisioning and thus preparing for possible futures.  Scientists also increasingly use scenarios and storylines as ways to explore the implications of environmental change and societal choices.
