**Description:**

ecoKoin is a mobile real-world action game (RWAG) that uses the power of community-based interaction, crowdsourcing, and game mechanics to foster sustainability and learning through ecofriendly challenges. This app-based game allows players to learn about sustainable actions, share creative ideas, and connect with others.

How to Play:
1. Browse: find out what others are up to by browsing recent actions
2. Interact: eate, comment on, and share other player’s actions 
3. Do: earn 1 ecoKoin each time you photograph an ecofriendly action and explain why it makes an impact
4. Compete: see which person and team can earn the most ecoKoins!

The app was piloted as part of a campus sustainability initiative at Barnard College in spring 2017. The pilot ran for three weeks among three classes of first year students. Approximately 45 students participated in the pilot, which featured sample “eco-missions” that integrated Barnard’s sustainability programs and goals. The highest scoring class and individual student received prizes. Results from pre/post surveys conducted as part of the pilot suggest that the frequency of performing environmentally-friendly actions improved significantly after playing ecoKoin. Players agreed that as a result of playing ecoKoin, they were more aware of and knowledgeable about actions they could take to help the environment. Results also indicate that the competitive aspect of the app was highly motivating in encouraging sustainable actions.
