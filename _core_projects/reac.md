**Description:**

From increasing temperatures to changing weather patterns to earlier wildfire seasons, Alaska is experiencing the effects of rapid Arctic climate change. These changes impact the lives and the traditions of Alaska Native communities. The Signs of the Land: Reaching Arctic Communities Facing Climate Change (ReAC) Camp Academy was developed to facilitate in-depth dialogue about climate change and explore its impact through the cultural lens of Alaska Native communities. The ReAC project built on the model established by the Association of Interior Native Educator's Elder Academy. 

The week-long camp, which took place during during the summer in 2014 and 2016, integrated local observations, traditional knowledge, and western climate science.  Participants gained an understanding about the impacts of climate change from Alaska Native elders and local climate researchers, and also learned about climate communication tools and resources for responding.

Participants designed individual outreach plans to share what they learned at camp with others in their community and beyond.  The camp was designed for Alaska Native educators, local leaders and planners, and rural community members.
