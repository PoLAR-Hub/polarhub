**Description:**

From increasing temperatures to changing weather patterns to earlier
wildfire seasons, Alaska is experiencing the effects of rapid Arctic
climate change.  How do these changes impact the lives and the
traditions of Alaska Native communities?

The Signs of the Land: Reaching Arctic Communities Facing Climate Change
(ReAC) Camp Academy facilitates in-depth dialogue about climate change
and explores its impact through the cultural lens of Alaska Native
communities.

The week-long camp integrates local observations, traditional knowledge,
and western climate science.  Participants gain an understanding about
the impacts of climate change from Alaska Native elders and local
climate researchers, and also learn about climate communication tools
and resources for responding.

Participants design individual outreach plans to share what they learned
at camp with others in their community and beyond.  The camp is designed
for Alaska Native educators, local leaders and planners, and rural
community members. 

The first Signs of the Land ReAC Camp took place at the Howard Luke
Gaalee’ya Camp by the Tanana River near Fairbanks, Alaska in July 2014.
 Outcomes from the camp include: 

-   Participants’ attitudes showed positive change; after the Camp,
    there was strong agreement about their ability to communicate about
    climate change, their awareness of climate science language, and how
    to locate resources, tools and strategies to for sharing and
    informing others about climate change.
-   Participants confirmed the value of elders in helping them
    understand, respond, and adapt to climate change, and that the camp
    setting facilitated an in-depth discussion and sharing of knowledge.
-   Participants were satisfied, and found the organization,
    facilitation, and content went beyond expectations. They felt the
    camp was “100%” successful, and they were grateful for the
    opportunity. They received new information and felt well prepared to
    include climate change resources into their community.
