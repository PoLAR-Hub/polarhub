Based on the approach of the US Navy's [Fleet Arctic Operations
Game](https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/Research---Gaming/War-Gaming/Documents/Publications/Game-Reports/FAOG-Game-Report-Final.pdf),
participants take on the roles of key Arctic stakeholders in this marine
spatial planning activity.  Players set resource and development
priorities based on changing conditions in the region, and negotiate to
resolve conflicts and manage competing interests.  The game is currently
available as a facilitated classroom activity via the [CAMEL
website](http://camelclimatechange.org/camel/activities/Game_SMARTIC_Arctic_Case_Study "SMARTIC on CAMEL").
 

All materials for the facilitated classroom version of SMARTIC are
available through the [CAMEL website](http://camelclimatechange.org/camel/activities/Game_SMARTIC_Arctic_Case_Study).
 If you need guidance on how to run the activity, or have feedback based
on your experience, contact us at polar@ei.columbia.edu.
