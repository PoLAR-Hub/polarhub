**Description:**

Participants in the Strategic Management of Resources in Times of Change (SMARTIC) simulation take on the roles of key Arctic stakeholders and utilize marine spatial planning concepts in order to create a sustainable, multi-use management plan for the Arctic Ocean.  Players set resource conservation and development priorities based on changing conditions in the region, and negotiate to resolve conflicts and manage competing interests. The simulation is based on the approach of the [US Navy's Fleet Arctic Operations Game](https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/Research---Gaming/War-Gaming/Documents/Publications/Game-Reports/FAOG-Game-Report-Final.pdf).

Educators have used SMARTIC with a wide vareity of audiences, including high schoolers, college and graduate students, and lifelong learners. The simulation is frequently cited as a highlight during course evaluation and feedback. For example, one instructor noted that during a semester debrief with students, "SMARTIC came up again as something they really enjoyed playing, providing new insights that made an impression on them."

**Resources:**

All of the materials needed to facilitate SMARTIC in formal and informal educational settings are available through the [CAMEL website](http://camelclimatechange.org/camel/activities/Game_SMARTIC_Arctic_Case_Study).
