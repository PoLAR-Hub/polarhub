# What is The PoLAR Hub?
Welcome to the website for the Polar Learning and Responding: PoLAR Climate Change Education Partnership. With support from the National Science Foundation, PoLAR designed and produced a portfolio of innovative approaches to climate change education. In addition to engaging audiences of all ages around the world on the topic of polar climate change, the Partnership conducted research on the effectiveness of the tools and resources created during the project. The PoLAR Hub website features information about our partners, our projects, and our results, including where you can find our tools and resources.
