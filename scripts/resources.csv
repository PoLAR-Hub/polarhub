After a brief synopsis on current issues and management approaches in the Arctic, players use information based on the stakeholder information provided to pinpoint areas of high interest, set conservation and development priorities, negotiate to resolve conflicts, and develop a sustainable, multi-use management plan for high priority areas. Players gain an increased understanding of the complex web of stakeholder interests and scientific issues and also learn how to devise a strategic plan for a global issue and an area of significant socio-economic, political, and environmental importance.","Participants take on the roles of key Arctic stakeholders in this marine spatial planning activity.  Players build off of an introductory presentation on climate change in the Arctic to devise a strategy to manage competing interstes and climate change impacts on a global scale (the Arctic).

The participant's goal in DCCS is to maintain the carbon dioxide concentration stock within an acceptable range around the goal value of 938 GtC. The participant decides on emissions of two different types: deforestation and burning of fossil fuels. The participant sets the fossil fuel and deforestation emissions. The DCCS moves autonomously by a number of time steps to a future year and calculates carbon dioxide concentrations and absorptions from making the emissions.

Permafrost, some of which has persisted since the last ice age, more than 10,000 years ago, is melting rapidly. In affected areas, this has led to building and road damage, shrinking lakes, rapidly eroding river banks, and the disappearance of some wildlife, including fish. Scientists such as Gunter Weller, who is featured in the video, suggest that these changes will continue to worsen unless society reduces its use of fossil fuels.

Permafrost, some of which has persisted since the last ice age, more than 10,000 years ago, is melting rapidly. In affected areas, this has led to building and road damage, shrinking lakes, rapidly eroding river banks, and the disappearance of some wildlife, including fish. Scientists such as Gunter Weller, who is featured in the video, suggest that these changes will continue to worsen unless society reduces its use of fossil fuels.
","This video adapted from Spanner Films describes the effects of changes to permafrost, the frozen layer of soil and ice that underlies much of Alaska, caused by a warming climate. Permafrost, some of which has persisted since the last ice age, more than 10,000 years ago, is melting rapidly. In affected areas, this has led to building and road damage, shrinking lakes, rapidly eroding river banks, and the disappearance of some wildlife, including fish.

At the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University, run by NASA's sibling agency, NOAA, researchers modeled a 5,000 year period to see how polar ice might behave over time depending on several different variables. This visualization shows a 120-year slice of that complete model, essentially offering a research window on to experimental processes that require longer time frames than human lifetimes. According to the model shown here, projecting a period from 1940 to 2060, there is evidence to suggest human factors have had a measurable effect on Arctic ice decreases.

Students need to become aware of the issues connected with this phenomenon.
This exercise is meant to be performed in a computer laboratory where students can  work individually or in pairs.  Undergraduate students use Google Earth and information from several web sites to investigate some of the consequences of climate change in polar regions, including the seasonal and longer-term changes in the extent of the ice cap at the North Pole, disintegration of ice shelves, opening of shipping routes, access to sources of fossil fuels, geopolitics, effects on polar bears, and possible secondary effects on climate in other regions due to changes in ocean currents.

The simulation intends to make vivid some of the future scenarios developed by Global EESE. The experience takes place in a 3D environment where the player is presented with a familiar scene set in the present day and a future scene set in 2032.
The future scenario manifests the worst outcomes of the scenarios.  Within the 3D environment are a series of characters with whom the player can interact. Through these conversation the player learns of the characters situations and perspectives on the environment. As the conversations progress the player makes certain decisions, influencing the characters to be more aware of the environment and potential risks.  If the player successfully convinces the characters to be more aware they create a positive change in the future. The player can move between the future and the present as they complete puzzles and conversations to see the effects of their choices. When the game is completed a montage depicting the future sums up the consequences of the players choices.
