The world's polar regions are changing rapidly.  What implications do
these changes have for polar ecosystems and communities?  How do they
compare to changes of the past?  Do changes in the Arctic and
Antarctic regions affect life outside of the poles?  The Polar
Learning and Responding Climate Change Education Partnership (PoLAR
CCEP) seeks to inform public understanding of and response to climate
change through the creation of novel educational approaches that
utilize fascination with shifting polar environments and are geared
towards lifelong learners.

Supported by a five year grant from the National Science Foundation,
the PoLAR Partnership is developing a suite of interactive and
game-like tools that capitalize on the iconic imagery of the Arctic
and Antarctic, areas of the globe that are experiencing the most
dramatic shifts in climate.  Games and game-like activities are
increasingly used to engage diverse participants in problem solving.
Focusing on the poles also leads to discussion of broader impacts,
especially as the changes taking place in the polar regions are
increasingly linked to concerns about rising sea levels and extreme
weather around the globe.  Adult learners, be they community leaders,
the general public, pre- and in-service teachers, or college students,
are today's decision makers and are more likely to make informed
decisions if they understand the scientific evidence of climate change
and its social, economic, and environmental consequences.

The PoLAR Hub is based upon work supported by the National Science
Foundation under Grant Number DUE-1239783. Any opinions, findings, and
