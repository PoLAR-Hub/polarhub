Embedded in this challenge there is also opportunity, as parks offer visual, historic, and tangible examples of the impacts of climatic change on both small local scales and large landscape and ecosystem levels. Billions of people around the globe enjoy parks and protected areas of all sizes and jurisdictions each year. Engaging these broad audiences is a significant opportunity for parks. This report indicates that, through innovative programming, interpretation and signage, partnerships, and transparent mitigation and adaptation strategies, parks can maximize the relevancy, funding, and visitor outreach opportunities that climate change communication provides.",

NASA\u2019s Images of Change app lets you take a close-up view of many of these changes in an exciting and hands-on format. The app presents a curated collection of the best image pairs from NASA\u2019s Global Climate Change website. These image pairs show areas that have been subject to natural disasters or seen significant change over time. Compare Alaska\u2019s Muir Glacier in 1941 to the glacier as it looked in 2004. Take a before-and-after look at flooding in the Missouri River or at wildfires in Colorado. See the expansion of agriculture in Saudi Arabia as viewed from satellites. All photo pairs can be viewed individually, side by side, or overlaid with a slider bar for easy comparisons. Each image pair contains background information and a map showing its location. The images presented in Images of Change are meticulously selected and constantly updated to give you an informative, compelling, and up-to-date visual experience.",

Permafrost, some of which has persisted since the last ice age, more than 10,000 years ago, is melting rapidly. In affected areas, this has led to building and road damage, shrinking lakes, rapidly eroding river banks, and the disappearance of some wildlife, including fish.

At the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University, run by NASA's sibling agency, NOAA, researchers modeled a 5,000 year period to see how polar ice might behave over time depending on several different variables. This visualization shows a 120-year slice of that complete model, essentially offering a research window on to experimental processes that require longer time frames than human lifetimes. According to the model shown here, projecting a period from 1940 to 2060, there is evidence to suggest human factors have had a measurable effect on Arctic ice decreases.\n",

The experience takes place in a 3D environment where the player is presented with a familiar scene set in the present day and a future scene set in 2032.\nThe future scenario manifests the worst outcomes of the scenarios.  Within the 3D environment are a series of characters with whom the player can interact. Through these conversation the player learns of the characters situations and perspectives on the environment. As the conversations progress the player makes certain decisions, influencing the characters to be more aware of the environment and potential risks.  If the player successfully convinces the characters to be more aware they create a positive change in the future. The player can move between the future and the present as they complete puzzles and conversations to see the effects of their choices. When the game is completed a montage depicting the future sums up the consequences of the players choices.\n",

VGAS\u00a9 is a virtual reality simulation game, distributed in CD, that demonstrates the impact of energy use and lifestyle on climate change. Developed using the latest interactive technology to look at hundreds of different choices we can make, the game is set in a 3D house where in each room, players can enter data about equipment, heating and lifestyle choices in their own home to assess their personal impact on climate change.\n",

The scientific community has convened conferences, published reports, spoken out at forums and proclaimed, through statements by virtually every national scientific academy and relevant major scientific organization \u2014 including the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) \u2014 that climate change puts the well-being of people of all nations at risk. Surveys show that many Americans think climate change is still a topic of significant scientific disagreement. Thus, it is important and increasingly urgent for the public to know there is now a high degree of agreement among climate scientists that human-caused climate change is real. Moreover, while the public is becoming aware that climate change is increasing the likelihood of certain local disasters, many people do not yet understand that there is a small, but real chance of abrupt, unpredictable and potentially irreversible changes with highly damaging impacts on people in the United States and around the world.",

A \"UN Secretary General\" receives pledges from three different \"blocs\", asks her or his technical staff to simulate them in the C-ROADS climate simulation (or its simpler version, C-Learn), and informs delegates of results, often sending them back for another round of debate, strategizing, and collaboration. agreement to mitigate climate change.
