[**'Climate Change Games as Tools for Education and
Engagement'**](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v5/n5/full/nclimate2566.html)

Abstract: Scientists, educators and policymakers continue to face
challenges when it comes to finding effective strategies to engage the
public on climate change. We argue that games on the subject of climate
change are well-suited to address these challenges because they can
serve as effective tools for education and engagement. Recently, there
has been a dramatic increase in the development of such games, many
featuring innovative designs that blur traditional boundaries (for
example, those that involve social media, alternative reality games, or
those that involve direct action upon the real world). Here, we present
an overview of the types of climate change game currently available, the
benefits and trade-offs of their use, and reasons why they hold such
promise for education and engagement regarding climate change.

**[Ask US - Change Over Time: Investigate Climate Change Impacts in
Alaska](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/c5d4hpl5cvfor54cdfhbi4bt680)**

Description: [The National Climate Assessment, released in May of 2014,
summarizes the impacts of climate change on the United States, touching
on many disciplines: earth science, biology, human health, engineering,
technology, economics, and policy.  Explore the document with lead NCA
author Sarah Trainor, and find out about related educational resources
with Jessica Brunacini of the PoLAR Climate Change Education
Partnership, Elena Sparrow of the International Arctic Research Center,
and Malinda Chase of the Association of Interior Native Educators. Learn
more about the rapid changes taking place in Alaska, ask questions about
the science behind the report and related learning resources, and
discover how to bring the NCA to life for learners of all ages.

[**‘Arctic Warming and Your Weather: Public Belief in the
Connection’**](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.3796/abstract)

Abstract: Will Arctic warming affect mid-latitude weather? Many
researchers think so, and have addressed this question through
scientific articles and news media. Much of the public accepts such a
connection as well. Across three New Hampshire surveys with more than
1500 interviews, 60% of respondents say they think future Arctic warming
would have major effects on their weather. Arctic/weather responses
changed little after Superstorm Sandy brushed the region, but exhibit
consistently strong partisan divisions that grow wider with education.
Belief in an Arctic/weather connection also varies, in a nonlinear
pattern, with the temperature anomaly around day of interview.
Interviewed on unseasonably warm or cool days, respondents are more
likely to think that Arctic warming would have major effects on their
weather.  This unscientific response seems to mirror the scientific
discussion about extremes.

**‘[Greenify: Fostering Sustainable Communities via
Gamification](http://www.gameprof.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Lee-et-al-2013-CHI-Greenify.pdf)’**

Abstract: At Teachers College, Columbia University, the Games Research
Lab has created *Greenify, *an online social platform designed to foster
flourishing sustainable communities. Gamification elements facilitated
the creation and completion of user-generated missions, encouraging
interaction between geographically proximate communities of peers. Three
elements were identified as necessary components to achieve sustainable
communities: a healthy climate and environment, social well-being, and
economic security. This paper describes our approach in addressing these
elements through a crowdsourced, gamified system. Implications for
human-computer interaction are also discussed.

[**‘Greenify: A Real-World Action Game for Climate Change
Education’**](http://sag.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/01/09/1046878112470539)

Abstract: The literature on climate change education recommends social,
accessible action-oriented learning that is specifically designed to
resonate with a target audience’s values and worldview. This article
discusses *Greenify*, a real-world action game designed to teach adult
learners about climate change and motivate informed action. A pilot
study suggests that the game fostered the creation of peer-generated
user content, motivated informed action, created positive pressure, and
was perceived as a fun and engaging experience.
