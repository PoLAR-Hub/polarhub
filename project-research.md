            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
                The PoLAR Research project is focused on learning more
                about public understanding of and attitudes about
                polar climate change and how it relaters to their
                lives. Our research will also analyze the value of
                interactive, game-like approaches to climate change
                education, including how effective these tools are for
                encouraging systems thinking, problem solving, and
                cooperation.

                We conduct a series of occasional polar knowledge and
                belief questions on broad statewide (New Hampshire)
                public opinion polls.  The surveys provide insights
                and baseline data on the state of general-public
                knowledge about polar regions, which could be useful
                to all the other PoLAR projects. Publications based on
                this work to date include:

                A set of new polar knowledge and belief questions were
                included in the fall 2014 New Hampshire survey, the
                results of which will be reported at the December 2014
                meetings of the American Geophysical Union.
