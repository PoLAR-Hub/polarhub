On November 7th and 8th, members of the PoLAR Partnership came together at Columbia University to update one another on project activities, share feedback, and discuss opportunities for collaboration.  Partners also engaged in conversations about cultural responsiveness, strategies for outreach and communication, and emerging themes related to polar climate change.  A highlight of the meeting was the game night, where partners had the chance to play a mix of PoLAR games, including FutureCoast, SMARTIC, and EcoChains - as  you can see in the photo, our team takes games very seriously!
