The National Climate Assessment offers a wealth of actionable science about the causes, effects, risks and possible responses to human-caused climate change. NOAA, the NCAnet Education Affinity Group, and members of the CLEAN Network have developed a series of guides for educators that focus on the regional chapters of the Assessment Report, helping to unpack the key messages of each region and point to related, high-quality online learning resources.

Compiled and reviewed by the PoLAR Partnership, the Alaska Region page features key figures and related resources from the report as well as guiding questions, lesson plans, videos and visualizations for all the NCA key messages for the region.  The page contains information that will help educators and students gain a deeper understanding of climate science and the implications of climate variability and climate change in the Alaska region.
