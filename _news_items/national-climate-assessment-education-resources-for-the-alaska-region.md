The National Climate Assessment offers a wealth of actionable science
about the causes, effects, risks and possible responses to human-caused
climate change. NOAA, the [NCAnet Education Affinity
Group](http://ncanet.usgcrp.gov/partners/affinity-groups/education),
and members of the [CLEAN
Network](http://cleanet.org/clean/community/cln/index.html) have
developed a series of guides for educators that focus on the regional
chapters of the Assessment Report, helping to unpack the key messages of
each region and point to related, high-quality online learning
resources.

Compiled and reviewed by the PoLAR Partnership, the [Alaska Region
page](http://www.climate.gov/teaching/alaska-region) features key
figures and related resources from the report as well as guiding
questions, lesson plans, videos and visualizations for all the NCA key
messages for the region.  The page contains information that will help
educators and students gain a deeper understanding of climate science
and the implications of climate variability and climate change in the
Alaska region.
