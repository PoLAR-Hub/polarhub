Maps and photographs help connect people visually to remote locations
that are undergoing impacts from a changing climate. Puzzles offer a
kinesthetic way to interact with and learn about scientific data.  The
PoLAR Partnership combined these engaging learning tools and developed a
series of puzzle-based activities that highlight the rapid changes
taking place in the Arctic, Alaska, and Antarctica.  The puzzle
activities can be used (1) in classrooms with groups or teams of
students completing a puzzle and sharing what they learned with the rest
of the class, or (2) in informal education settings as a facilitated
experience to explore polar climate change.  

Below,  you will find the information and materials needed to create
your own set of polar puzzle activities.  Using maps, data
visualizations, and photographs from the Arctic, Alaska, and Antarctica,
these activities match a physical puzzle with supporting imagery to tell
a story about our changing climate.  For each activity you will find an
image labeled "puzzle" which you can download and use to order a **20 x
28 inch**, **48+ piece** puzzle from a variety of online custom puzzle
shops.  Three of the puzzles (Antarctica, Plateau Glacier, and Pedersen
Glaceir) are paired with a supporting image or set of maps that can be
used as underlays on which to build the puzzle.  These underlays are the
same location but show different times or features, and should be
printed at the same dimension as the corresponding puzzle (20 x 28
inches).  The fourth puzzle (Arctic Ocean) has overlay pieces
representing changing sea ice.

**Antarctica**

The puzzle is a MODIS Satellite image of the ice covering Antarctica.
The accompanying set of underlays include:

-   a bed topography map of Antarctica, showing the rock surface
    beneath the ice sheet, with sections of the land that have been
    pushed below sea level by the weight of the ice
-   an ice velocity map, showing how ice flows across the continent and
    towards the ocean, with some areas moving more quickly than others
-   a geographic map, showing the location of scientific stations and
    other physical featues
-   an ice mass loss image, showing where we are losing ice from melt,
    calving, and/or sublimation, with some areas losing mass more
    rapidly than others
-   a map of subglacial lakes, showing locations of lakes that are
    formed by geothermal heat from the interior of the
    Earth
-   an ice elevation map, showing the amount of ice mounded on West and
    East Antarctica

**Plateau Glacier, Alaska**

The puzzle is a photograph of the Plateau Glacier in 2003. The
underlay is a photograph of the same glacier from the same perspective
in 1961. Over this 42 year period, the ice has all but disappeared.  For
scale, there are two people standing on the peninsula in both
images.

**Pedersen Glacier, Alaska**

The puzzle is a photograph of the Pedersen Glacier in 2005. The
underlay is a photograph of the same glacier from the same perspective
in the 1920s. Over this \~80 year period, the glacier has effectively
disappeared.

Underlay: [PedersenGlacier\_1920s\_Underlay.png]({{ site.url }}{{ "/files/PedersenGlacier_1920s_Underlay.png" }})

**Arctic Ocean**

The puzzle is the International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean
basin. Without the sea ice that normally covers the Arctic Ocean, people
might find it unrecognizable.  There are three accompanying overlay
images of the summertime minimum extent of Arctic sea ice.  The first
two show sea ice extent from the summers of 1984 and 2012 based on
satellite data.   The third image features a projection for summer sea
ice extent in 2050 based on climate models.  We suggest printing these
images at the same scale as the puzzle and then cutting out just the sea
ice sections and placing them on top of the completed puzzle. You can
use the printed piece directly, but we suggest either laminating it or
tracing it onto pieces of white foam for use.  There is a suggested
script for this puzzle activity as
well.
