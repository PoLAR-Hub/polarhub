Maps and photographs help connect people visually to remote locations that are undergoing impacts from a changing climate. Puzzles offer a kinesthetic way to interact with and learn about scientific data.  The PoLAR Partnership combined these engaging learning tools and developed a series of puzzle-based activities that highlight the rapid changes taking place in the Arctic, Alaska, and Antarctica.  The puzzle activities can be used (1) in classrooms with groups or teams of students completing a puzzle and sharing what they learned with the rest of the class, or (2) in informal education settings as a facilitated experience to explore polar climate change.

Below, you will find the information and materials needed to create your own set of polar puzzle activities.  Using maps, data visualizations, and photographs from the Arctic, Alaska, and Antarctica, these activities match a physical puzzle with supporting imagery to tell a story about our changing climate.  For each activity you will find an image labeled “puzzle” which you can download and use to order a 20 x 28 inch, 48+ piece puzzle from a variety of online custom puzzle shops.  Three of the puzzles (Antarctica, Plateau Glacier, and Pedersen Glaceir) are paired with a supporting image or set of maps that can be used as underlays on which to build the puzzle.  These underlays are the same location but show different times or features, and should be printed at the same dimension as the corresponding puzzle (20 x 28 inches).  The fourth puzzle (Arctic Ocean) has overlay pieces representing changing sea ice.
