The PoLAR Partnership is happy to announce that we have been selected to present at the upcoming [Alaska Math and Science Conference](https://sites.google.com/site/2013akmathsciconference/).  The conference serves as an opportunity for local teachers and administrators to learn about innovative educational approaches for bringing STEM into their districts, schools, and classrooms.  The theme of this year's meeting in Anchorage is "Changing Climates: Tracking Trends," and includes a special focus on climate change research.  Co-PI Elena Sparrow and Partner Margie Turrin will lead four sessions highlighting the educational games, activities, and other novel tools developed by PoLAR as well as opportunities for professional development.

Conference participants will have the chance to learn about the Arctic marine ecosystem while playing the [EcoChains]({{ "/core_projects/ecochains" | relative_url }}) card game, take on the roles of Arctic stakeholders in the [SMARTIC]({{ "/core_projects/smartic" | relative_url }}) activity, and find out how they can sign up for a climate change course offered through the [American Museum of Natural History]({{ "/core_projects/amnh_climate_courses" | relative_url }}).  We are excited to engage with Alaskan educators and to learn how we can best meet their needs for polar climate educational resources.
