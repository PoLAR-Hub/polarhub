In an effort to develop innovative, multidisciplinary approaches to climate change education and deliver content that supports and informs decision-making, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funds six research-driven Climate Change Education Partnerships (CCEP) that include teams of climate scientists, learning/social scientists, state and national networks, and education practitioners working in very diverse settings, including the Pacific Islands, urban regions, and the North American Arctic.  NSF also funds the [CCEP Alliance Office](http://ccepalliance.org/) to foster collaborative interactions and activities among the projects. 

After five years of planning, implementing, testing, and revising CCEP programs, certain key lessons are emerging across the projects that may benefit other existing or emerging climate change education programs. The Alliance recently collaborated to develop a guide that highlights the group's collective efforts and provides research-based recommendations for climate education and communication practitioners working with diverse audiences. At the core of all Alliance projects is the recognition that educators have an opportunity and an obligation to identify and adapt their approaches to specific audiences. Each population has unique interests in and motivations for learning about climate change, and also bring their own valuable perspectives and knowledge to the table. 

The new guide - [Climate Change Education: Effective Practices for Working with Educators, Scientists, Decision Makers, and the Public](http://ccepalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/CCEP_Final_Feb2017.pdf) - seeks to provide a few tested models that illustrate climate change education in different situations. Case studies present approaches to interdisciplinary climate education and engagement that use learning tools like games, maps, tours, interactive models, video, and place-based activities. In addition to highlighting a variety of effective educational approaches, the guide also describes how climate science content can be translated into more accessible components for specific audiences, including visitors to informal learning institutions like museums and aquariums, local business leaders and policy makers, classroom teachers, and Indigenous communities. 

CCEP Alliance members also conducted a [series of webinars](http://ccepalliance.org/2017/03/2017-webinar-series/) about each chapter of the guide, providing additional details about research and specific examples of projects. PoLAR Partners participated in the [Working with Indigenous Communities webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acRKjHK7l3s), highlighting the Signs of the Land: Reaching Arctic Communities Facing Climate Change Camp experience and lessons learned.
