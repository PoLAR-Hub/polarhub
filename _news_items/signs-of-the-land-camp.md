The 2016 Signs of the Land: Reaching Arctic Communities Facing Climate Change Camp was held June 13-17 in Fairbanks, Alaska.  Hosted by the Association of Interior Native Educators, the University of Alaska Fairbanks International Arctic Research Center, and the PoLAR Partnership, the camp brought together Alaska Native Elders, formal and informal educators, science communicators, subsistence practitioners, and western climate scientists.   Building off of the success of previous engagement events with Alaska Native community members, the camp facilitated the exchange of knowledge about climate change, from both Indigenous and western science perspectives. With the guidance of four Native Elders, the 14 camp participants spent the week sharing their observations of change to the local environment, learning about the climate system and cause of climate change, and engaging in in-depth dialogue about impacts and solutions.  


A key focus of the camp was building the capacity of participants to serve as climate communicators in their communities and among their networks.  Camp facilitators highlighted research on and examples of effective approaches to climate change education and engagement, including poetry, storytelling, videos, and games. Participants designed individual outreach plans tailored to their interests and communication styles, with the goal of reaching at least 20 people.  Outreach plans ranged from classroom-based activities to public presentations to [newspaper articles](http://www.newsminer.com/features/sundays/community_features/native-elders-scientists-talk-action-plans-for-fighting-climate-change/article_521aaab6-3b23-11e6-a0f1-1b0ac4a80df7.html).  Based on feedback, participants were very satisfied with the camp experience.  They strongly agreed that Elders' knowledge can help them understand climate change, and that, in addition to affirming traditional practices and supporting connections to the land, the camp setting facilitated the sharing of knowledge held by the Elders.  As one participant noted, "Learning in the context of traditional Alaska Native practices and from our Elders has been central to this experience."
