Announced in December 2014 as part of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy's Climate Literacy and Education Initiative, the National Climate Game Jam was held over the weekend of October 2-4, 2015, with over 350 participants at 11 sites throughout the US.  In addition to playing a critical role in the planning and development of the national event, the PoLAR Partnership hosted a Climate Game Jam site at Barnard College in New York City.  15 people participated in the event, comprised of a diverse mix of college undergraduates, graduate students, and young professionals.  Seven of the participants were game design students from the Hostos Community College in the Bronx.    

In addition to a [live streamed event kick-off](http://climategamejam.org/climate-game-jam-2015-16-archive/launch/) that featured a talk by PoLAR Partner and FutureCoast Project Lead Ken Eklund, the participants also heard from Pfirman, who presented on effective climate communication practices, Lee, who shared expertise regarding game design considerations, Co-PI Peter Schlosser, who spoke about climate impacts and solutions, and Sarah Cornish of Games for Change, who highlighted successful examples of science-based games.  After hearing from experts, the participants worked together in small teams to collaboratively design and develop a total of four game prototypes, ranging in topic from natural resources and ecosystems to preparation, adaptation, and decision-making.  

Based on evaluation of the event, participants showed increased awareness of climate change impacts and responses after the Climate Game Jam and also indicated that they were likely to tell others what they learned about climate change.  One of the games developed at the Barnard Site – [Countdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIAIzSIHbTE&feature=youtu.be) – was awarded 3rd place in the College Division of the National Climate Game Jam competition.
