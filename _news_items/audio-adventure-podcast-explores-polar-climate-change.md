An audio adventure series podcast produced by the University of Alaska
Museum of the North has debuted on the PoLAR Hub website. [PoLAR
Voices]({{ "/core_projects/polar_voices" | relative_url }}) is part of Columbia
University's [PoLAR Climate Change Education
Partnership]({{ "/core-projects" | relative_url }}), which
includes UAF and is supported by a five-year, 5.6 million dollar grant
from the National Science Foundation to develop a suite of innovative
educational tools that engage people in learning about and responding to
polar climate change.

UAMN head of exhibits and digital media production Roger Topp said PoLAR
Voices will explore change at the poles through the voices of the people
who study, live and work there. "Most of us do not have the opportunity
to travel to the places that are most affected by climate change and
speak with people who live and work there. They need a guide. These
programs immerse audiences in the polar environments through a synthesis
of radio drama and documentary."

The podcast features several episodes each season, to be released online
over the next few years. The episodes will take listeners to the polar
regions – the arctic tundra, coastline and oceans, the Antarctic ice cap
and the Southern Ocean. And they'll do it with sound.

"We are writing a radio play that will transport characters and
listeners to the far corners of the earth," Topp said. "With audio, the
earth can have corners and ends and everything can be closer together
than nature dictates. Our voices are no longer constrained by
geography."

The fully produced programs include layers of multilingual voice acting,
ambient sound and an array of polar climate change topics. Listeners
will meet scientists and residents who are working together to better
understand and respond to climate change in the Arctic, and scientists
devoted to explaining the scope, scale, nature and impacts of climate
change in the Antarctic. Each episode will be accompanied by online
materials that enable listeners to engage more deeply with the research
featured and an opportunity to learn more about the people involved.

Maribeth Murray, executive director of the Arctic Institute of North
America at the University of Calgary and a research affiliate at UAF's
International Arctic Research Center, is the lead for the PoLAR Voices
project and one of the PoLAR Partners. She said that games and other
forms of innovative communication are increasingly used to engage
diverse participants in learning about complex issues and for problem
solving.

"The PoLAR Voices radio series is designed to speak to a very wide
audience and to entice people into learning more about polar climate
research, which in turn will enable broader and better public
understanding of global climate change," she said.
