The PoLAR Partnership, along with partners at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Zulama, coordinated the [Arctic Climate Game Jam](http://climategamejam.org/), which was held April 21-30 at 10 sites around the U.S. and in Palau. The event built off of two previous National Climate Game Jam events that NOAA coordinated in 2015 and 2016, and was inspired by the [2016 Arctic Science Ministerial meeting](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/28/fact-sheet-united-states-hosts-first-ever-arctic-science-ministerial). The Arctic Climate Game Jam offered a unique opportunity for students, educators, scientists, and game designers to work together on the development of new game prototypes that help players learn about the effects of as well as solutions to climate change in the Arctic through a science-based, interactive experience.  Game design teams chose from important Arctic-related topics that included changing sea levels, sea ice and glacier melt, ocean acidification, impacts on Indigenous communities, shifting ecosystems, and more. The event allowed participants to work as design teams, learn science facts, consider how a changing Arctic affects us all, and produce engaging experiences for audiences of many ages. 

To help kick-off the event, PoLAR created an [intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzOw43ht1cI&t=1s) featuring PI Stephanie Pfirman, Peg Steffen from NOAA, and Sara Cornish from Games for Change. More than 100 people participated in the event, ranging in age and experience from elementary school to professional game designer. Following the event, design teams were encouraged to submit 2-minute videos about the games they developed to be considered by a panel of expert judges for national recognition. 28 submissions were received and reviewed by judges in early June. Winners were chosen by age category: K-8, High School, College/University, and Professional. A total of [12 games](http://climategamejam.org/finalists/) were chosen for recognition based on their design, creativity, scientific accuracy, and potential impacts. All of the submissions can be viewed on the [climategamejam.org website](http://climategamejam.org/climate-game-jam-2015-16-archive/) and the winners will be featured in a blog post hosted by Games for Change.
