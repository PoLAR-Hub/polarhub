In spring 2014, Pranoti Asher, Manager of Education and Public Outreach for the American Geophysical Union (AGU), contacted the PoLAR Partnership to discuss opportunities for integrating educational gaming into the 2014 Fall Meeting. Working with Michelle Hall of Science Education Solutions, Randy Russell of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) Center for Science Education, and Juliette Rooney-Varga of Climate Interactive, PoLAR organized two events that took place during the conference: a [Game Night](http://fallmeeting.agu.org/2014/events/game-night/) and a workshop on [Integrating Serious Games into Climate Change Education](http://fallmeeting.agu.org/2014/events/integrating-serious-gaming-into-climate-change-education/).  

The Game Night event offered an opportunity to AGU participants, particularly first time attendees, to meet and mingle while learning about fun and innovative approaches to science communication. Games featured at the event included PoLAR's EcoChains and FutureCoast, as well as [Challenge and Persuade](http://isenm.org/product/challenge-and-persuade/), [Thirst for Power](http://isenm.org/product/thirst-for-power/), the Game of Bowens, and a variety of short computer-based games. 40 people attended the event, many of whom played their way through all of the games offered. The Serious Games workshop provided an introduction to the pedagogy of using games for climate change education and allowed participants to engage with examples, including some of the previously mentioned games as well as PoLAR's SMARTIC role play simulation. 35 people attended the workshop. Participants from both events offered very positive feedback, including several requests for more game events at future AGU meetings. One workshop attendee noted that, "Serious games are an excellent means of mediating science and should be promoted!"
