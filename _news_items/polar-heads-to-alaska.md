From declining sea ice to thawing permafrost to stronger coastal storms,
Alaska is at the forefront of polar climate change.  Recognizing the
importance of addressing this challenging topic within education,
organizers for the biennial Alaska Math and Science Conference (AMSC)
chose "Changing Climates: Tracking Trends" as the theme for the 2013
meeting.  

PoLAR Partners Elena Sparrow, Margie Turrin, Malinda Chase, Jessica
Brunacini, and Kelsey Gobroski attended AMSC, held October 18-20 in
Anchorage, AK.  The PoLAR Partnership hosted four sessions during the
conference focused on opportunities for professional development and the
use of innovative tools for climate change education.  Teachers who
participated in the sessions were excited to learn about and interact
with PoLAR resources,
including [SMARTIC]({{ site.url }}{{ "/core_projects/smartic" }}), [Polar
Explorer]({{ site.url }}{{ "/core_projects/polar_explorer" }}), [EcoChains]({{ site.url }}{{ "/core_projects/ecochains" }}),
and [AMNH's online professional development course on climate
change]({{ site.url }}{{ "/core_projects/amnh_climate_courses" }}).
 Many teachers expressed a strong interest in using the PoLAR tools in
their classrooms.  They also provided valuable feedback as to what could
increase the use of the resources throughout Alaska, for example
highlighting Native Alaskan values and providing tips on adapting tools
to different environments and ecosystems.

In addition to hosting sessions, PoLAR team members participated in a
number of sessions led by other organizations, including the [National
Park
Service](http://www.nps.gov/subjects/climatechange/index.htm), [PolarTREC](http://www.polartrec.com/),
and the [Alaska Center for Ocean Science Education
Excellence](http://www.coseealaska.net/), to learn more about the wide
variety of climate change education resources and programming available
to Alaskan teachers.  Kelsey Gobroski also collected interviews and
audio from the conference for the [Polar
Voices]({{ site.url }}{{ "/core_projects/polar_voices" }}) project.   

Following the conference, Margie Turrin and Jessica Brunacini drove down
to Seward to visit the [Alaska SeaLife
Center](http://www.alaskasealife.org/) and discuss potential
collaborations.  Along the way, they stopped at the [Alaska Wildlife
Conservation Center](http://www.alaskawildlife.org/), where they were
able to see caribou, moose, and wood bison.  The last stop on their
adventure was the [Exit
Glacier ](http://www.nps.gov/kefj/planyourvisit/exit-glacier.htm)in
Kenai Fjords National Park, which is closely monitored by park officials
due to the rate at which it is retreating.  They were impressed to see
an informational sign from the National Park Service explaining the
links between climate change and glacial retreat to park visitors - a
fitting note on which to end the trip.
