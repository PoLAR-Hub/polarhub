An activity developed by the PoLAR Partnership's Principal Investigator, Stephanie Pfirman, provides learners with a hands-on opportunity to explore how Arctic sea ice is shrinking and what it means for species like polar bears and walrus.  Recently updated to include new data, a description of the activity, including background information, a facilitator script and accompanying poster, is available for use in classrooms and at public events via the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory's Polar Weekend Science Activities page.
