Strategic Management of Resources in Times of Change (SMARTIC) is a spatial planning, role play simulation in which students gain a hands-on understanding of what it means to be an Arctic stakeholder and how difficult it can be to manage valuable resources as sea ice retreats.  In this game developed by PoLARâ€™s Stephanie Pfirman, players identify vulnerable areas within the game region and experience the complexity of managing competing stakeholder interests, all the while keeping in mind the implications of a rapidly changing environment.  The instructions and materials required for running SMARTIC in the classroom are now available on the CAMEL website.
