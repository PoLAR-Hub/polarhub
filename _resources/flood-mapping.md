This website provides a mapping tool to visualize sea level rise (SLR).  The map connects Google's mapping API with NASA data on SLR. Features include ability to set the level of SLR from 1 - 7 m and zoom from global to neighborhood level to see the effects of SLR locally. However, the data provides a simplified simulation of SLR that does not take into account several factors such as tides, coastal erosion or coastal differences, for example.
