This website provides a mapping tool to visualize sea level rise
(SLR). The map connects Google's mapping API with NASA data on
SLR. Features include ability to set the level of SLR from 1 - 7 m and
zoom from global to neighborhood level to see the effects of SLR
locally. However, the data provides a simplified simulation of SLR
that does not take into account several factors such as tides, coastal
erosion or coastal differences, for example.
