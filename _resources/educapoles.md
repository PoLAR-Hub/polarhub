EducaPoles is one of IPF's four websites. It aims to make young people and their teachers more aware of the importance and the fragile nature of the polar environments, and to enable them to learn about climate changes from this angle.
EducaPoles offers the educational world a number of tools (teaching dossiers, multimedia animations, comic strips, etc.). It has also set up a series of international teaching projects in cooperation with institutes, universities and NGOs (Antarctica2003, ClimaTIC, Soleil Noir sur Continent Blanc,...)
The EducaPoles site offers teachers and pupils direct access to key information, as well as up-to-date news on current and upcoming projects, and a space for latest news on teaching events and materials linked to the polar environment and climate changes.
