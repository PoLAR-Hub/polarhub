LogiCity is a fun interactive computer game with a difference. It's a game set in a 3D virtual city with five main activities where you are set the task of reducing the carbon footprint of an average resident. As you work their way through the game you have to try and cut your carbon footprint from a typical English figure of 5.5 tonnes to a level of 2.0 tonnes. You can score extra points based on how well you have done the tasks, and can compete against other players to record the highest points score. At the end of the game you are taken forward to 2066 to see if they have done enough to save England from the worst problems associated with global climate change.
