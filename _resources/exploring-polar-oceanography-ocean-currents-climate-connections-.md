This lesson plan allows students to examine the polar climate through maps, images and online data tools, explore density currents and their relation to the oceanic circulation system though laboratory experiments, create graphs and analyze climate data, investigate the relationship between polar ocean phenomena and coastal climates, and connect climate change in the polar regions with global climate change.
