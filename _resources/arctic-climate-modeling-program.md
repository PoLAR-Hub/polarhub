The research-based Arctic Climate Modeling Program (ACMP) is funded by NSF ITEST. The site features an extensive collection of curriculum resources focused on a wide variety of topics relating to Arctic climate change, which were designed with input from 21 scientists from the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute. Resources include K-12 inquiry-based classroom lessons, a student network for observing arctic weather, digital lectures, and an interactive multimedia learning system (on DVD).
