The onset of climate change has become one of the greatest challenges facing parks and protected areas in the 21st century. Climate change has created new problems and exacerbated existing issues by redefining historic weather and environmental conditions. Embedded in this challenge there is also opportunity, as parks offer visual, historic, and tangible examples of the impacts of climatic change on both small local scales and large landscape and ecosystem levels. Billions of people around the globe enjoy parks and protected areas of all sizes and jurisdictions each year. Engaging these broad audiences is a significant opportunity for parks. This report indicates that, through innovative programming, interpretation and signage, partnerships, and transparent mitigation and adaptation strategies, parks can maximize the relevancy, funding, and visitor outreach opportunities that climate change communication provides.
