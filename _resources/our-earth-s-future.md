Our Earthâ€™s Future is about the science of climate change and how to talk about it. You will learn from scientists in the fields of climatology, oceanography, Earth science, and anthropology who study how climate change is affecting people, populations, and ways of life. Explore the multiple lines of evidence for the human-induced climate change that is happening today, and consider what that means for the future of our planet. At the end of this course, you will be able to understand key scientific principles, identify and address misconceptions, and contribute confidently to conversations about climate change.
