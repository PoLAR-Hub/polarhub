The Earth Exploration Toolbook (EET) is a collection of online Earth system science activities developed by teams of scientists and educators.  In this chapter focused on historical evidence of climate change, you will: learn how various climatic conditions impact the formations of sediment layers on the ocean floor; view an interactive animation of ice-shelf advance and retreat and sediment rates; and download and use specialized scientific software, Paleontological Stratigraphic Interval Construction and Analysis Tool (PSICAT), to create graphic models of sediment cores based on data provided by ANtarctic geological DRILLing (ANDRILL) scientists.  Can be used for professional development or in grades 6-16.
