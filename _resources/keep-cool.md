KEEP COOL is a board game on climate change where you are a “global player” in climate politics. You try to advance your own economic interests, while strong lobby groups like the oil industry or environmental groups affect whether you win or loose. At each turn you have to decide between joint climate protection and self-interest. The risk: droughts, floods and health pandemics. The chance: welfare and keeping a stable global climate. The winner is the one who reaches her target first. But, if you are not careful enough, all players lose.
