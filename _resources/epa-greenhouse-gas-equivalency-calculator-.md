This tool allows users to estimate their carbon footprint based on their individual household energy consumptin.  The calculator consists of three sections.  The first allows for an estimate of individual household total emissions;  the second allows exploration of  actions the individual can take to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, and waste disposal costs;  the third lets the user see how much they can save (in dollars and emissions) by taking the actions they chose in Section 2
