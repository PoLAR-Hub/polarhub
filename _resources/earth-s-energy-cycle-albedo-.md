Classroom curriculum for a lesson on the role of albedo.  Through an experiment, students explore how the color of materials at the Earthâ€™s surface effect the levels of warming, develop a hypothesis, collect data, and make interpretations, and, in the end, should be able to explain why dark colored materials become hotter.
