Stakeholders is a video story telling project sponsored by the International Arctic Research Center (IARC) and funded by the National Science Foundation. The goal is to bring rural community members and university scientists into discussions about climate and environmental change in Alaska. The communities of Tanana, Ft. Yukon, and Chalkyitsik are the focus of the effort to date.
