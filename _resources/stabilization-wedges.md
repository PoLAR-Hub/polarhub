The Stabilization Wedges game is a team-based exercise about the scale of the greenhouse gas problem, plus technologies that already exist to dramatically reduce our carbon emissions and get us off the path toward dramatic and damaging climate change.  Players pick eight carbon-cutting strategies to construct a carbon mitigation portfolio, & fill in the 8 wedges of the stabilization triangle.
