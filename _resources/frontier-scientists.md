The goal of Frontier Scientist is to excite the general public about scientific discovery in Alaska and the Arctic. Topics covered include a vast range from geology, ecology, and marine biology to chemistry, humanities, and archaeology. The website includes articles and videos that are built to educate, entertain, and inspire.  There is also a mobile app to explore ongoing science in Alaska and the Arctic.  In addition to the website, you can follow Frontiers Scientists on Twitter (@FrontierSci), YouTube (Frontier Scientists Channel), and Facebook (Frontier Scientists).
