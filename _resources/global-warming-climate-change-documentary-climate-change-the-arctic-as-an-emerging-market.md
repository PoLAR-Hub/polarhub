Many nations have been looking to the Arctic with renewed interest as the region has undergone an unprecedented rate of change due to climate change. Recent observations, however, have shown that the summer Arctic ice cover is shrinking at an even greater pace than originally estimated, creating a greater sense of urgency over issues such as access to shipping lanes, oil and gas exploration, impact to indigenous populations, and priorities for scientific investigation. In this video recording, panelists Heather Conley of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Jed Hamilton of ExxonMobil, and Julienne Stroeve of the National Snow & Ice Data Center discuss projections for the Arctic region. Moderated by NPR's Richard Harris, this installment in the Global Challenges Discussion Series was held at AAAS Headquarters in downtown Washington, DC.
