This web site incorporates images and information from the Arctic: A Friend Acting Strangely exhibition developed by the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, which was on display at the Museum through November 2006. The exhibition puts a human face on warming in the Arctic by exploring how changes have been observed and documented by scientists and polar residents alike.  
Features include educational activities that extend the themes and content of the exhibit to middle school students, their teachers, and families.  Activities explore changes that impact the Arctic’s environment, its wildlife, and its peoples.  The activities also explore how the Arctic’s climate connects to our global climate system.
