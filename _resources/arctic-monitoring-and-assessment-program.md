The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program (AMAP) is mandated to: monitor and assess the status of the Arctic region with respect to pollution and climate change issues; document levels and trends, pathways and processes, and effects on ecosystems and humans, and propose actions to reduce associated threats for consideration by governments; and produce sound science-based, policy-relevant assessments and public outreach products to inform policy and decision-making processes. Their website has a wide range of resources including data and reports on the Arctic region. As well they host a number of educational events both in the region and around the world.
