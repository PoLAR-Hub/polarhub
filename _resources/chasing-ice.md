Traveling with a team of young adventurers across the brutal Arctic, Balog has risked his career and his well-being in pursuit of the biggest story facing humanity.Use Chasing Ice to fly from glacier to glacier, to see through the lens of Balog's camera, and to touch our planet as it changes before our eyes.
