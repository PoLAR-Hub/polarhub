Skeptical Science is now available as a free app for the iPhone or iPod. You can now use an iPhone or iPad to view the entire list of skeptic arguments as well as (more importantly) readily access what the science says on each argument. The app connects to the website regularly so when new skeptic arguments, recent research or the latest data is added, the app automatically updates also.
