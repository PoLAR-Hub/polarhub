The Alliance for Climate Education (ACE) provides resources for High School students and teachers to understand climate change science and solutions. Their primary tool is the ACE Assembly which is a presentation for high school students to teach them the science behind climate change, help them find solutions they can be apart of and inspire them to take action in their community to make a difference. They also create a network of students to help facilitate the discussion and get students working on projects across the country. In addition to this student focus they also have a number of resources for teachers to help students continue the conversation about climate change. There is also a teacherâ€™s network, which includes newsletters and lesson plans and keeps teachers up to date on climate opportunities for their students.
