The Clim’City® game is set against the background of “global thinking for local
action”. This virtual environment aims at showing how, in a western industrialised
country like France, one can opt for sustainable life styles, beneficial to Earth and its inhabitants. The Guidebook for how to play the game is available at:  http://climcity.cap-sciences.net/us/livret-clim-InEnglish.pdf.
