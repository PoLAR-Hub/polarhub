The  Scientific Visualization Studio facilitates scientific inquiry and outreach within NASA programs through visualization. To that end, the SVS works closely with scientists in the creation of visualization products, systems, and processes in order to promote a greater understanding of Earth and Space Science research activities at Goddard Space Flight Center and within the NASA research community.  The animation found on the website portrays fluctuations in the cryosphere through observations collected from a variety of satellite-based sensors.video beginning in the Antarctic region and moving to the Artic region.
