VGAS was developed by the European Commission’s Directorate-General Joint Research Centre.  VGAS© is a virtual reality simulation game, distributed in CD, that demonstrates the impact of energy use and lifestyle on climate change. Developed using the latest interactive technology to look at hundreds of different choices we can make, the game is set in a 3D house where in each room, players can enter data about equipment, heating and lifestyle choices in their own home to assess their personal impact on climate change.
