My 2050 is an online interactive tool in which you try to reduce CO2 emissions in the UK to 20% of 1990 levels and help avoid dangerous climate change. Using sliders, which are based on the latest UK data, you can decide what actions should be taken to reduce carbon emissions by 2050. You will see the impact of the changes on home, city and country.
This web presence is a visualisation as well as simplification of the 2050 Pathways Analysis in order to further share its findings. The Department of Energy and Climate Change is keen to engage in an open and transparent debate around the choices and trade-offs the United Kingdom faces to reach the 2050 emissions reduction target. The data you are entering on this site will feed into this debate.
