World Climate is a role-playing climate simulation designed by MIT and Climate Interactive that provides the experience of creating an international solution to stabilizing carbon dioxide levels. The game is set up as a highly simplified international climate change negotiating meeting where participants play the role of delegates from different regions of the world and work together to reach a global accord that meets the group's goal for CO2 levels. A "UN Secretary General" receives pledges from three different "blocs", asks her or his technical staff to simulate them in the C-ROADS climate simulation (or its simpler version, C-Learn), and informs delegates of results, often sending them back for another round of debate, strategizing, and collaboration. agreement to mitigate climate change.  Exercises run 1.5-3 hours.
