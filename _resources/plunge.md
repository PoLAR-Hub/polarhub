Plunge, an art+science installation project by Michael Pinsky, imagines a time 1000 years in the future when the effects of runaway climate change have completely transformed the London we know today.  Plunge placed on three monuments in central London. A string of low energy blue LED lights were wrapped around three iconic landmarks in central London, marking a time, 1000 years in the future, when sea level rises have changed the city beyond recognition.
The monuments are ones that are passed every day by hundreds of thousands of people, whether tourists who stop to photograph them, or commuters who walk by every day without seeing them. Plunge offered an opportunity to see them in a new light, to think about their place in our history and their place in the city.  The Plunge site includes additional informaion on sea level rise beyond the project.
