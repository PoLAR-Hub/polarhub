A collection of indicators that can be used to understand how the environment is changing. The indicators communicate some of the key aspects of how the climate is changing such as: temperatures over land and sea, greenhouse gas levels, sea ice extent, etc. Some show trends over time while others show the status of certain resources. Each indicator has a description of what the results mean and some implications. All the indicators are fully traceable and documented by detailed metadata the user can access.
