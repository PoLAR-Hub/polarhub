The simulation is specifically designed for climate communicators, educators, and leaders of the World Climate Exercise, but people coming from a wide array of backgrounds will find it insightful. C-Learn can help people understand the long-term climate effects (CO2 concentrations, global temperature, sea level rise) of various actions to change CO2 emissions, like those from fossil fuels, deforestation, and planting trees. You can ask multiple, customized "what if" questions and understand why the system reacts as it does. Users can access as guest or free user registration (2013)
