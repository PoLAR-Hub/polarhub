Life On Thin Ice leverages the power of photography combined with science to communicate accurately and effectively about climate change in the Arctic, increase public interest in the issues and understanding of the problems, and motive informed action to address the gorwing climate crisis. It seeks to document the changes, educate people and policy makers about the issues and galvanize effective action.
