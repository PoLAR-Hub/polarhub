Climate change is a prominent topic in the media, and its effects are expected to present major challenges for human society. Students need to become aware of the issues connected with this phenomenon.
This exercise is meant to be performed in a computer laboratory where students can  work individually or in pairs.  Undergraduate students use Google Earth and information from several web sites to investigate some of the consequences of climate change in polar regions, including the seasonal and longer-term changes in the extent of the ice cap at the North Pole, disintegration of ice shelves, opening of shipping routes, access to sources of fossil fuels, geopolitics, effects on polar bears, and possible secondary effects on climate in other regions due to changes in ocean currents. 
Students learn to use satellite and aerial imagery, maps, graphs, and statistics to interpret trends accompanying changes in the Earth system.
