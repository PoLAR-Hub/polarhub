This video adapted from Spanner Films describes the effects of changes to permafrost, the frozen layer of soil and ice that underlies much of Alaska, caused by a warming climate. Permafrost, some of which has persisted since the last ice age, more than 10,000 years ago, is melting rapidly. In affected areas, this has led to building and road damage, shrinking lakes, rapidly eroding river banks, and the disappearance of some wildlife, including fish. Scientists such as Gunter Weller, who is featured in the video, suggest that these changes will continue to worsen unless society reduces its use of fossil fuels.
