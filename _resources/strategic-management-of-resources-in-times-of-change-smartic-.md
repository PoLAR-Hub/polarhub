Participants take on the roles of key Arctic stakeholders in this marine spatial planning activity.  Players build off of an introductory presentation on climate change in the Arctic to devise a strategy to manage competing interstes and climate change impacts on a global scale (the Arctic). After a brief synopsis on current issues and management approaches in the Arctic, players use information based on the stakeholder information provided to pinpoint areas of high interest, set conservation and development priorities, negotiate to resolve conflicts, and develop a sustainable, multi-use management plan for high priority areas. Players gain an increased understanding of the complex web of stakeholder interests and scientific issues and also learn how to devise a strategic plan for a global issue and an area of significant socio-economic, political, and environmental importance.
