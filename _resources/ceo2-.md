CEO2 is a game that puts players in the role of a CEO in one of four major industries from 2010-2030. Climate Change is the biggest threat facing nature and humanity in the 21st century.  CEO2 was designed to raise awareness about the need for business leaders to balance their concerns for profit and climate change, and the options available to them.  The options in this game, the figures associated with them, the future scenarios, and the stakeholder opinions were developed based on feedback from experts.  They are simplified and approximated for the purpose of game play, and may not always closely reflect current or future realities in these industries.
