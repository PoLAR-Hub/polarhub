The former editor-in-chief of The Guardian emails his staff on Christmas Eve saying that he wants to tackle 'the biggest story ever told', climate change. The 12 episode podcast examines the role of The Guardian in advocating for and combating an end to climate change. Centered around the idea to 'keep it in the ground' this podcast looks at the economics, politics, and even psychology around climate change. A key focus is in divestment.
