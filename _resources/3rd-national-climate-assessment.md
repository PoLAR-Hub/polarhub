This 3rd National Climate Assessment (NCA) report summarizes the impacts of climate change in the US now and in the future. The NCA concludes that the evidence of human induced climate change continues to strengthen and that impacts are increasing across the country. It collects, integrates and assesses observations and research from around the country to help understand what is actually happening and what this means for the lives, livelihoods and future for Americans. Information is presented in an interactive report that allows people to filter by selecting topics and regions of interest.
