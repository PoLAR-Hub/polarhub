PASSPORT TO ANTARCTICA (PTANT) builds on resources originally gathered to support a series of live, interactive "electronic field trips." These materials have now been completely re-edited and reformatted into an evergreen package of materials that can be implemented anytime during the school year, and anywhere there's a teacher dedicated to turning young minds on to the wonders of the natural world.
