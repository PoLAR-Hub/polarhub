This game is in the form of a timed quiz. Wrong answers speed up the clock with each graphic but the timed aspect of it means you speed by it.  This game allows the player to examine Earth interactions and how it has changed over time and look at how humans fit into an already complex and changing Earth system.  Works for HS and above using embedded facts and videos but also testing prior knowledge
