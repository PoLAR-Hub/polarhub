Greenland's natural environment and traditional way of life are being transformed by climate change. This documentary -- produced by Arirang TV for world-wide broadcast in association with the Copenhagen Climate Summit -- takes you to northwest Greenland, and to Siorapaluk, the northernmost settlement on Earth. Featuring the images and insights of photographer Jenny E. Ross, the program shows you the majesty of the Arctic, the drama of melting glaciers and disappearing sea ice, and the poignant plight of the Inuit people as they struggle to preserve their traditional lifestyle in the face of climate change.
