Through an online game, students learn how carbon cycles through the Earth system. Students understand that carbon cycles naturally through living and non-living parts of the Earth system in a complex and non-linear way. Students will also understand that burning fossil fuels adds carbon to the cycle and the impact of additional carbon dioxide on global warming. Students also learn that carbon is essential for living things.(2006)
