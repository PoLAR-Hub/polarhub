ANDRILL (ANtarctic geological DRILLing) is a multinational collaboration comprised of more than 200 scientists, students, and educators from seven nations (Brazil, Germany, Japan, Italy, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States) to recover stratigraphic records from the Antarctic margin using Cape Roberts Project (CRP) technology. ANDRILL'S chief objective is to drill back in time to recover a history of paleoenvironmental changes that will guide understanding of how the rate, size, and frequency of glacial and interglacial changes in the Antarctica region."
