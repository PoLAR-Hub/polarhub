A lesson plan focused on the links between sea level and ice volume, in which students identify the relationship between global climate change and Earth's ice volume and sea level, and interpret climatic history through examining the characteristics and relative ages of layers of ice in an ice core sample. Features visualizations, videos, and hands-on activities.
