This website contains educational video clips and "hands-on" educational activities to pring polar science into the classroom in a way that allows many aspects of actual and ongoing real-world research to be simulated inexpensively and easily, but still reasonably authentically. Students can see seals and penguins in video clips, and then experience - literally "hands-on" in the Blubber Glove activity - some of the physical adaptations which allow these creatures to survive in extreme conditions. As in "Differential Effects of Melting Ice" Activity, they can experiment with ice cubes and discover the different effects of melting sea-ice and land-based ice on sea level rise. Combining math skills with authentic data, they can plot trends in greenhouse gases and see why changes in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has become such a hot topic.
