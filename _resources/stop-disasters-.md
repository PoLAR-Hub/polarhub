A decision making simulation game focused on natural distasters, including wildfires, flooding, and hurricanes. Players assess disaster risk and make choices to limit the damage.  They are given a budget to work with and a project to complete.  Advice is offered along the way in helping to make choices that help to reduce the risk and impacts of disasters.
