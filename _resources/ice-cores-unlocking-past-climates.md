A set of five video learning modules and companion curricuuar resources explain what we know and how we know about the earthâ€™s climate.  The lessons begin by clarifying the difference between weather and climate; proceed to give us a closer look at glaciers and the records they hold of climatic events over extraordinarily long periods of time and show how scientists collect and study glacial ice cores to trace climate history.
