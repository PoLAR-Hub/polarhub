The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Simulator is an interactive tool developed by the MIT System Dynamics Group to explore the issue of climate change. Explore how greenhouse gas emissions are related to atmospheric concentrations and temperature change. Explore how much greenhouse gas emissions need to change, and how fast, to reduce the risk that human activity will cause dangerous changes in the climate.
