Discover Antarctica in greater detail than ever before by exploring the nine versions of the Landsat Image Mosaic of Antarctica (LIMA). Each version highlights different features of the landscape. Created from over 1,000 Landsat 7 ETM+ scenes, LIMA consists of two principle mosaics, six stretched versions and one center-filled mosaic. The map viewer displays the mosaics and Landsat scenes in polar stereographic projection using Web Map Service (WMS). Site also contains dowloadable maps, factsheets and images.
