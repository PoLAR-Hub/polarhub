The MODIS Mosaic of Greenland (MOG) Image Map (2005) is a composite image of 104 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images acquired over the 2005 spring season. It provides a nearly-perfect cloud-free view of the ice sheet, ice shelves, and land surfaces at a grid scale of 100 m, and an estimated spatial resolution of 150 to 200 m. All land areas and islands larger than a few hundred meters surrounding Greenland are included in the mosaic, as well as the ice caps on Baffin Island, Devon Island, Axel Heighberg Island, and Ellesmere Island.
