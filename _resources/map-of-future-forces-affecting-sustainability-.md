Produced by the Institute for the Future for the Global Environmental Management Initiative, this decision making support tool shows the interactions and synergies between 6 main drivers projected to influence business and sustainability between 2007 and 2017.  The map encourages using foresight and long-term thinking to help reveal insights that can lead to more effective action and sustainability in the present.  A 45-minute video about the map and how to use it is also available.
