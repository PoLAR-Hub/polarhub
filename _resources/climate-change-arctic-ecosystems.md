Using this curriculum from the Activities for Conceptualizing Climate Change program, 7-12 grade teachers and students will analyze Arctic temperatures and the ways in which they affect sea ice, calculate changes in sea ice area and predict the year when the sea ice will disappear, and analyze polar bear population data and the influence of sea ice on these numbers.
