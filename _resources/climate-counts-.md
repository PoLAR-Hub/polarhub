A mobile app available for free download, Climate Counts analyzes and ranks companies based on how well they are addressing climate change. Don’t know which burger/airline ticket/laptop/sneakers/hotel room you should buy? Maybe the company’s climate performance can help you decide. Climate Counts uses a 0-to-100 point scale and 22 criteria to determine if companies have:* MEASURED their climate "footprint"; *REDUCED their impact on global warming; *SUPPORTED (or suggest intent to block) progressive climate legislation; *Publicly DISCLOSED their climate actions clearly and comprehensively. (2012)
