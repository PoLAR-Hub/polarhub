With support from the National Science Foundation, the Polar Learning and Responding: PoLAR Climate Change Education Partnership developed, implemented, and evaluated a portfolio of innovative educational approaches that have been used to:
* Deepen lifelong learner awareness and understanding of climate change
* Advance knowledge of more effective models for climate change education  
* Engage diverse audiences through professional development and public outreach 

PoLAR tools and resources were created based on scientific evidence, learning theory, and education practice, including current and emerging instructional technology, and have catalyzed new ways of learning about climate change by:
* Providing transformative educational approaches that are easy to disseminate and exciting to use in homes, museums, classrooms, and communities
* Inspiring change in methods, practices, and policies through the seeding of game-like approaches in informal and formal educational environments
* Framing fun, participatory endeavors to spark peer learning

The Climate Change Education Partnership program was established by the National Science Foundation to develop a "coordinated national network of regionally- or thematically-based partnerships devoted to increasing the adoption of effective, high quality educational programs and resources related to the science of climate change and its impacts." The PoLAR Partnership began with a Phase I planning grant that ran from 2010-2012, and was subsequently awarded a 5 year, Phase II implementation grant. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of our collaboration, we worked with natural and social scientists, polar experts, classroom teachers, museum educators, communication specialists, game designers, policy makers, economists, Indigenous leaders, and more. Through our projects and outreach, we engaged tens of thousands of people around the world on this issue of climate change. Please see the Research section for more information about the resutls of our work.
