[**'Eyes Off the Earth? Public Opinion Regarding Climate Science and NASA'**](http://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1307&context=carsey)

Abstract: Survey researchers have observed significant political divisions in the United States with regard to public trust of science related to
evolution, the environment, vaccines, genetically modified organisms, and other topics. Conservatives are less likely than moderates or liberals to say they trust scientists for information on any of these topics. Some of the widest divisions involve climate change, an area where the Trump administration and conservatives in Congress have proposed steep reductions in research. For example, the president’s detailed budget proposal in May 2017 calls for cuts to the Earth science and education programs of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Congressional efforts have also often targeted NASA Earth science.

[**'Arctic Knowledge of the U.S. Public'**](https://www.arcus.org/witness-the-arctic/2017/5/highlight/2)

Abstract: The Polar, Environment, and Science (POLES) survey, carried out in two stages in August and November–December of 2016, is the most recent nationwide project to assess Arctic knowledge. The twostage design allowed testing for differences before and after the U.S. election, but those turned out to be minor. Another unique aspect of this survey was its deliberate oversampling of Alaska residents, so for the first time we could compare their Arctic knowledge with that of other U.S. residents. Randomsample telephone interviews were carried out by trained interviewers at the Survey Center of the University of New Hampshire. Of the 1,407 people interviewed, 398 live in Alaska, with the remainder scattered among other states. A published report on the August stage of this survey gives details about survey methods and the full range of questions asked (Hamilton 2016). This article includes the November– December interviews as well, for a sharper view of how Alaska residents compare with other Americans in their knowledge about the Arctic..

[**'Public Awareness on the Scientific Consensus of Climate'**](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2158244016676296)

Abstract: Questions about climate change elicit some of the widest political divisions of any items on recent U.S. surveys. Severe polarization affects even basic questions about the reality of anthropogenic climate change (ACC), or whether most scientists agree that humans are changing the Earth’s climate. Statements about scientific consensus have been contentious among social scientists, with some arguing for consensus awareness as a “gateway cognition” that leads to greater public acceptance of ACC, but others characterizing consensus messaging (deliberate communication about the level of scientific agreement) as a counterproductive tactic that exacerbates polarization. A series of statewide surveys, with nationwide benchmarks, repeated questions about the reality of ACC and scientific consensus many times over 2010 to 2016. These data permit tests for change in beliefs and polarization. ACC and consensus beliefs have similar trends and individual background predictors. Both rose gradually by about 10 points over 2010 to 2016, showing no abrupt shifts that might correspond to events such as scientific reports, leadership statements, or weather. Growing awareness of the scientific consensus, whether from deliberate messaging or the cumulative impact of many studies and publicly engaged scientists, provides the most plausible explanation for this rise in both series. In state-level data, the gap between liberal and conservative views on the reality of ACC did not widen over this period, whereas the liberal–conservative gap regarding existence of a scientific consensus narrowed.

[**'Where Is the North Pole? An Election-Year Survey on Global Change'**](https://carsey.unh.edu/publication/north-pole)

Abstract: To explore public knowledge and perceptions about climate change, University of New Hampshire researchers conducted the first Polar, Environment, and Science (POLES) survey in August 2016. A random sample of U.S. adults were asked for their views regarding science, climate change, sources of information, current problems, and possible solutions. In addition, the survey tested basic geographical knowledge related to polar regions, such as whether the United States has a significant population living in the Arctic, and what respondents know about the location of the North Pole.

[**'Polar Facts in the Age of Polarization'**](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1088937X.2015.1051158?journalCode=tpog20)

Abstract: Many drivers of polar-region change originate in mid-latitude industrial societies, so public perceptions there matter. Building on earlier surveys of US public knowledge and concern, a series of New Hampshire state surveys over 2011–2015 tracked public knowledge of some basic polar facts. Analysis indicates that these facts subjectively fall into two categories: those that are or are not directly connected to beliefs about climate change. Responses to climate-linked factual questions, such as whether Arctic sea ice area has declined compared with 30 years ago, are politicized as if we were asking for climate-change opinions. Political divisions are less apparent with factual questions that do not suggest climate change, such as whether the North Pole is on land or sea ice. Only 38% of respondents could answer that question correctly, and even fewer (30%) knew or guessed correctly that melting of Greenland and Antarctic land ice, rather than Arctic sea ice, could potentially do the most to raise sea levels. At odds with the low levels of factual knowledge, most respondents say they have a moderate amount or a great deal of understanding about climate change. A combination of low knowledge with high self-assessed understanding characterizes almost half our sample and correlates with political views. The low knowledge/high understanding combination is most prevalent among Tea Party supporters, where it reaches 61%. It also occurs often (60%) among people who do not believe climate is changing. These results emphasize that diverse approaches are needed to communicate about science with people having different configurations of certainty and knowledge.

Abstract: What does the public know, and how much do they care, about Arctic environmental change? What do their patterns of awareness and concern imply for science communication? Such questions motivate research that began in 2006 with a “polar module” of knowledge and concern items on the U.S.
General Social Survey (GSS). Responses to that survey display levels of public concern that might be encouraging, but have a darker side as well. Political orientation influences how people answer every concern question, from the Inuit way of life to preserving Antarctica for science (Hamilton 2008). Education and science knowledge matter too, but the effects of education and knowledge vary with political beliefs. Among liberal and moderate respondents, for example, expressed concern about polar change increases with education. Among the most conservative respondents, however, concern decreases with education.

[**'A Four Party View of US Environmental Concern'**](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09644016.2014.976485?scroll=top&needAccess=true)

Abstract: Research on US public concern about environmental issues finds ideology or political party are the most consistent background predictors. Party is commonly defined by three groups: Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. Here, using statewide New Hampshire survey data, we elaborate this approach to distinguish a fourth group: respondents who say they support the Tea Party movement. On 8 out of 12 science- or environment-related questions, Tea Party supporters differ significantly from non–Tea Party Republicans. Tea Party supporters are less likely than non–Tea Party Republicans to trust scientists for information about environmental issues, accept human evolution, believe either the physical reality or the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change, or recognise trends in Arctic ice, glaciers, or CO2. Despite factual gaps, Tea Party supporters express greater confidence in their own understanding of climate change. Independents, on the other hand, differ less from non–Tea Party Republicans on most of these questions—although Independents do more often accept the scientific consensus on climate change. On many science and environmental questions, Republicans and Tea Party supporters stand farther apart than Republicans and Independents.

[**'Do You Trust Scientists About the Environment?'**](http://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1213&context=carsey)

Abstract: In this brief, author Lawrence Hamilton examines the results of a Granite State Poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center in late January–early February 2014. The poll asked about public trust in scientists, along with other questions on science, political, and social issues that help to place the science-trust results in perspective. Almost two-thirds of New Hampshire residents surveyed say that they trust scientists to provide accurate information about environmental issues. Only 12 percent do not trust scientists to provide this information. Wide disparities occur along party lines, however, regarding this and other questions about science. The 53 percent gap between Democrats and Republicans on climate change is one of the largest for any issue. Trust in scientists shows a somewhat narrower Democrat–Republican gap (37 percent), which is larger than those for historically divisive social issues such as abortion or the death penalty. Answers to these survey questions also relate to respondents’ news media sources, even after statistical adjustments for political party, age, gender and education. People who often listen to New Hampshire Public Radio are more likely to say they trust scientists, and respond differently from other New Hampshire residents on several other science-related questions. People who often watch local television news or read newspapers, on the other hand, respond differently on questions about the death penalty or gun control.

[**‘Arctic Warming and Your Weather: Public Belief in the Connection’**](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.3796/abstract) 

Abstract: Will Arctic warming affect mid-latitude weather? Many researchers think so, and have addressed this question through scientific articles and news media. Much of the public accepts such a connection as well. Across three New Hampshire surveys with more than 1500 interviews, 60% of respondents say they think future Arctic warming would have major effects on their weather. Arctic/weather responses changed little after Superstorm Sandy brushed the region, but exhibit consistently strong partisan divisions that grow wider with education. Belief in an Arctic/weather connection also varies, in a nonlinear pattern, with the temperature anomaly around day of interview. Interviewed on unseasonably warm or cool days, respondents are more likely to think that Arctic warming would have major effects on their weather.  This unscientific response seems to mirror the scientific discussion about extremes.
