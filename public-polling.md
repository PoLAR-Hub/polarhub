What do most people know, and what do they believe, about Earth’s
polar regions? *Who* knows and believes *what*? This
post marks the beginning of the **Polar Polling**
series, a regular feature on the PoLAR Hub that explores survey
research on public perceptions.

Polar perceptions among people far from the poles began to
intrigue me years ago, as I was doing research on society and
environment in the Arctic. Arctic environments are changing, of
course, driven partly by things happening far away. So the
activities and perceptions of people in distant societies can
affect people and ecosystems in the Arctic.

Random-sample surveys provide a window on what the general public
knows and believes. In Polar Polling we will look at examples
where surveys have been applied to polar topics, much as they usually
are to politics or current events. Our first example, the [General
Social Survey](http://www3.norc.org/gss+website/) (GSS) has been
interviewing representative samples of the U.S. public about many
different subjects since 1972. Their 2006 edition, in preparation for
the [International Polar
Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Polar_Year) (IPY,
2007–2008), carried a new set of questions from the [National Science
Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OPP), intended to
assess public knowledge and beliefs about polar regions.

An article about that survey, "[Who cares about polar regions?
Results from a survey of U.S. public
opinion](http://instaar.metapress.com/content/73108783774p714j/),"
was published in 2008 in the journal Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine
Research. The
article presents results from the first round of GSS polar
questions, with statistical analysis and technical details. I’ll
summarize a few of the findings here; write if you’d like a copy
of the full article.

Five of the GSS questions were meant to assess polar
knowledge. The first five bar charts in Figure 1 show how people
answered; you can match your own guesses against theirs. We see,
for example, that only 41 percent of the respondents know that the
North Pole is on ice floating over the Arctic Ocean, although 67
percent know it is false that the sun never shines at the South
Pole. Just 44 percent know it is true that Inuit (often called
Eskimos) live north of the Arctic Circle. The sixth chart, at
lower right in Figure 1, plots the average number of correct
answers (0 to 5) against people’s self-assessment of how well
informed they are about polar issues (“don’t know” or “very
uninformed” to “very informed”). People who consider themselves
“very informed” answered an average of 3.3 questions correctly;
those “very uninformed” averaged just 2.

        information.

Other questions on the 2006 GSS sought opinions about possible
polar effects of global warming. Figure 2 charts these results;
again you can compare these with what you might answer. On the
survey, 70 percent say they would be bothered a great deal, and
only 4 percent not at all, if sea level rose 20 feet flooding
coastal regions. The sixth chart at lower right in Figure 2
depicts opinions about whether the Antarctic should be reserved
for scientific purposes, or opened for tourism, fisheries, oil and
other commercial purposes. Forty-three percent somewhat or
strongly support reserving Antarctica for science.

        economic purposes.

</figure>

The “Who cares” paper also contains a statistical analysis of who
holds these different opinions, and how opinions are related to
polar knowledge along with background characteristics such as age,
gender, income, education, political views and general science
literacy (tested by a set of 11 other questions on the
survey). Education, political views, polar knowledge and science
literacy prove to be the most consistent predictors of polar
opinions. For example, respondents with higher polar knowledge and
science literacy scores express greater concern about melting ice
caps, and about threats to polar bears or seals. Those with higher
polar knowledge also are more inclined to favor reserving
Antarctica for science.

The next installment of **Polar Polling** will
compare the 2010 survey results, post-IPY, with the pre-IPY
results from 2006. We will also look more closely at the
connections to science literacy scores. Both the 2006 and 2010 GSS
surveys asked a “first generation” of experimental polar knowledge
and belief questions, not previously tested on large surveys. More
specific questions building on that experience were then designed
for newer surveys beginning in 2011. Future installments of
**Polar Polling** will look at the newer surveys,
some conducted within the past month and with results not yet
published, to find out more about what people know, and who knows
what, concerning the polar regions.

<h1>Polar Polling, Part Two</h1>

What do most people know, and what do they believe, about the
polar regions? *Who* knows and believes what? This post marks the
second installment of **Polar Polling**, a regular feature on the
PoLAR Hub in which we look at survey research that explores public
perceptions. This time we’ll start in the middle of the story,
showing some interesting results before going back for more detail
about the sources.

##### Science Literacy and Concern about Polar Change

Two nationwide U.S. surveys, conducted in 2006 and 2010, found
that the more people know about polar regions, or the greater
their science literacy is in general, the more likely they are to
express concern about changing polar environments. The top left
image in Figure 1 charts the percent of people on two nationwide
surveys who say they would care “a great deal” if the northern ice
cap melts. Among people who got no answers correct on a 5-question
polar knowledge quiz, less than 30% care if the ice melts. This
percentage rises steadily with the number of right answers,
reaching more than 80% among those who answered all 5 questions
correctly. The top right image in Figure 1 shows a similar pattern
of rising concern as scores improve on an 11-point science
literacy test. Just over 20% of those who answered no science
questions correctly say they would care a great deal if the ice
cap melts. This rises to more than 80% among those with the
highest science literacy scores. Similar patterns in the two lower
charts show that support for reserving the Antarctic for science
also increases with higher polar knowledge and science literacy
scores.

         class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Figure 1">
</figure>

Figure 2 repeats this analysis for two other “concern”
questions. The same general pattern appears: the percent who say
they would care a great deal if sea level rise floods coastal
areas, or if polar bears become extinct, increases with higher
scores in both polar knowledge and general science literacy. These
survey results highlight the key role that science literacy plays
in public awareness about large-scale but seemingly distant
environmental problems.

##### Background on These Surveys

The data behind Figures 1 and 2 are from the [General Social
Survey](http://www3.norc.org/gss+website/), which has been measuring U.S. public beliefs on a wide
variety of topics since the 1970s. In 2006 and 2010, before and
after the [International Polar Year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Polar_Year) (2007–2008), the General Social
Survey included a set of questions concerning the north and south
polar regions. Some of these questions tested people’s knowledge
of the polar regions, or of scientific facts in general. Other
questions simply asked for opinions, such as how concerned people
felt about polar aspects of climate change.

Question wording, background information, and further analysis of
these polar surveys can be found in a brief published by the
Carsey Institute (now the Carsey School of Public Policy) at the
University of New Hampshire: “[Public knowledge about polar regions
increases while concerns remain unchanged](http://carsey.unh.edu/publication/public-knowledge-about-polar-regions-increases-while-concerns-remain-unchanged)” (2012). As the title
notes, detailed comparison of the 2006 and 2010 surveys suggests
that public knowledge of the polar regions had significantly
improved, but concern about polar aspects of global change (such
as melting ice, endangered species) remained divided along
political lines, with little overall movement. Likewise, public
support for reserving the Antarctic for science (rather than
opening it for commercial development) stayed about the same.

Two research articles take a more technical look at the surveys,
testing the influence of people’s individual background and
beliefs on polar perceptions, along with a number of different
measures of science education or knowledge:

“[Who cares about polar regions](http://instaar.colorado.edu/aaar/journal_issues/abstract.php?id=2601)” in Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research (2008);

“[Public knowledge and concern about polar region warming](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1088937X.2012.684155#preview)” in Polar Geography (2012).

##### What's Ahead

The General Social Survey questions from 2006 and 2010 represent a
first generation of polar polling. In our next installment we’ll
turn to the second generation of polls, which asked more specific
questions aimed at growing public awareness.

# Polar Polling, Part Three
#### by Larry Hamilton

<img src="{{ 'assets/img/algea.JPG' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid rounded float-right" style="max-width: 475px;">

What do most people know, and what do they believe, about the
polar regions? Who knows and believes what? This post marks the
third installment of Polar Polling, a regular feature on the PoLAR
Hub in which we look at survey research that explores public
perceptions.

##### Two Survey Questions About Polar Ice

The first two installments focused on questions carried by the US
General Social Survey (GSS) in 2006 and then again in 2010. These
surveys have been analyzed in a publicly accessible report:

“[Public knowledge about polar regions increases while concerns remain unchanged](http://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1156&context=carsey)” Carsey School (2012);

and also in two journal articles:

“[Who cares about polar regions](http://instaar.metapress.com/content/73108783774p714j/)” in Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research (2008);

“[Public knowledge and concern about polar region warming](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1088937X.2012.684155%23.VNKN5C6guxw)” in Polar Geography (2012).

Some of the GSS questions sought to test people’s knowledge about the polar regions. One asked about ice:

***Would you say the polar ice caps have gotten larger or smaller over the last 25 years?***

On the more recent (2010) GSS, 81 percent of respondents answered
“smaller,” which was meant to be the right answer. Someone
knowledgeable about polar regions could point out, however, that the
question is ambiguous. By “polar ice caps” the survey designers meant
sea ice, but did not say this explicitly. Both the north and south
polar regions contain huge ice sheets on land (Greenland and
Antarctica, respectively) which have very different physical
properties than sea ice. Sea ice is mainly frozen sea water. It is a
few feet or yards thick, floating on the ocean. Land ice is mainly
formed from compressed snow. It can be more than a mile thick, mostly
resting on land. Sea ice area expands by millions of square kilometers
each winter and then melts again by a similar amount each summer. Land
ice exhibits some seasonal melting but its area changes much more
slowly. Moreover, while Greenland and West Antarctic land ice have
been losing mass in recent years, East Antarctic land ice has been
closer to stable. And while Arctic sea ice area (especially in late
summer) has declined, Antarctic sea ice area has recently
increased. Thus, the “polar ice caps” question wording could lead into
a complicated discussion with various answers, some of them still
under research.

As both scientific and public discussion about climate change became
more nuanced in the years since the original GSS questions were
written (2005), there is a need for more detailed questions. On a 2011
national survey (NCERA) carried out by researchers at the Carsey
School of Public Policy, we asked:

***Which of the following three statements do you think is more accurate? Over the past few years, the ice on the Arctic Ocean in late summer ...***

1. *Covers less area than it did 30 years ago*
2. *Declined but then recovered to about the same area it had 30 years ago*
3. *Covers more area than it did 30 years ago*
4. *Don’t know/no answer*

This question avoids ambiguity by specifying sea ice (not land ice),
its location (Arctic), the measure of comparison (area), the season
(late summer), and the time frame (past few years compared with 30
years ago). Sixty-eight percent of the NCERA respondents chose “covers
less area,” which in this case unambiguously is correct. Figure 1
shows the GSS (2010) and NCERA (2011) results together, although their
differences in wording mean we cannot compare these directly. The more
detailed NCERA question, for instance, differs from GSS in having a
reasonable-sounding middle option “declined but then recovered,” which
drew 11 percent. The uncommon “same” response for GSS was not part of
the question, but volunteered by some respondents.

***Figure 1***

<figure class="figure">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/img/PP3Figure_1 copy.png' | relative_url }}"
         class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Figure 1">
</figure>

##### Change in Real Arctic Sea Ice

How do we know that “less area” is correct? Arctic sea ice area and
extent (two different but related measures) have been observed by
satellites since the 1970s. Figure 2 graphs September Arctic sea ice
area or extent as calculated by several different research
groups. Arctic sea ice area in September of recent years (as of the
2011 NCERA survey) had been fluctuating about two million square
kilometers below the areas measured thirty years before.

***Figure 2***

<figure class="figure">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/img/PP3Figure_2 copy.png' | relative_url }}"
         class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Figure 2">
</figure>

So two-thirds of the NCERA respondents got this sea-ice question
right. From an Arctic scientist’s point of view that level of public
awareness seems encouraging. But we will see that, as with ice itself,
these survey results are more complicated than they appear.

##### Demographics and Sea Ice Perceptions

From a social scientist’s point of view, results like Figure 1 are
just a first step. The next step, often more interesting, is to find
out who responded in each way. Survey answers across a wide range of
questions often show differences by demographic characteristics such
as age, gender, or education; and also by questions about people’s
worldview or more general beliefs. Figure 3 shows the percentage of
correct “less ice” responses on NCERA broken down by age, gender,
education and what people personally believe about climate change,
based on this question:

***Which of the following three statements do you personally believe?***

1. *Climate change is happening now, caused mainly by human activities.*
2. *Climate change is happening now, but caused mainly by natural forces.*
3. *Climate change is NOT happening now.*
4. *Don’t know/no answer*

***Figure 3***

<figure class="figure">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/img/PP3Figure_3 copy.png' | relative_url }}"
         class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Figure 3">
</figure>

The small gap between males and females (70 vs. 67 percent) in sea-ice
perceptions is not statistically significant, but other differences in
Figure 3 are. Older respondents are less likely to know that Arctic
sea ice area has decreased; respondents with college or postgraduate
education are more likely. People who believe that climate change is
happening now, caused mainly by human activities, very often (80
percent) say that ice has decreased. Those who agree that climate
change is happening, but mainly for natural reasons, are less inclined
(60 percent) to know or guess correctly that Arctic sea ice area
decreased. And those who don’t believe that climate change is
happening also don’t believe (32 percent) that Arctic ice has
decreased. The pattern of results likely reflects not just differences
in knowledge, but also a tendency for people to guess or form
convictions about a specific physical reality (area of Arctic sea ice)
based on their broader worldview or beliefs.

The NCERA survey included several non-polar but climate-related
questions as well. Some of these (such as whether CO2 in the
atmosphere is increasing) show both education and belief effects like
those in Figure 3, while others (such as whether sea ice or land ice
has more potential to raise sea level) relate to respondent education
only — perhaps because worldview or beliefs give no clues about how to
answer that question. A more detailed look at these results appears in
“[Did the Arctic ice recover? Demographics of true and false climate
facts](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/WCAS-D-12-00008.1)” in Weather, Climate, and Society (2012).

##### What's Ahead

In 2011 the nationwide NCERA survey tested this new sea ice question
nationally. At the same time, we started placing the same question on
statewide surveys in New Hampshire, which could be repeated from time
to time watching for signs of change as different news came in about
sea ice. We also began to experiment with other polar questions, such
as asking whether people believe that Arctic warming might affect the
weather where they live. The next installment of Polar Polling will
explore those results.
